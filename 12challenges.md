One of the bigger challenges was converting the high-level instructions into exact assembly language code that would manage the text file correctly by using Linux system calls. Planning the order of operations would make sure that the file was created and written to and then reopened and appended with new quotes as requested by the lab. Assembly being one unforgiving language, I gave close attention to registers and syscall numbers, double-checking each line so that no mistake would lead to either an error or unexpected result. I did not opt for trace or debug software but rather reviewed the syscalls I used and my code with great care before running it. The program ran fine from the very first attempt, and the output file had all the required content in it. Most of the error was in coming up with an error-free design from the start where each step strictly corresponded to the instructions to gain results that needed no debugging. This lab cemented strong discipline to assembly-level coding, attention to detail, and understanding how low-level operations interact with each other.
